       	   	<p class= "para">A CSE student who will intend to pursue his career on “Hardware designing” , the knowledge of E-Drawing is must.
Suppose a CSE/EC engineer has to design a CPU which is the Brain of the computer.

If you wznt to be a game developer, then you will understand how engineering drawing comes into rescue in representing something in 3D into 2D.</p>
